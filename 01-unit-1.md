<h3># Unit 1: Computer Networks and the Internet </h3>

<h3>1.1 The Internet</h3>
The Internet is a globally connected network system that facilitates communication and data services through a vast collection of private, public, business, academic, and government networks. It serves as a virtual infrastructure that links millions of computers and electronic devices worldwide, allowing users to exchange information seamlessly.

The Internet is decentralized, which means there is no central authority governing its operations. To enable communication between devices, the Internet relies on protocols and standards that govern how small units of data are formatted, addressed, and transmitted.

<h3>1.2 The Network Edge: Access Networks, Physical Media</h3>

# The Network Edge:

- The network edge the connection or interface between a device or local network and the internet. The edge is close to the devices it is communicating with and is the entry point to the network. The network edge is a crucial security boundary that network administrators must provide solutions for. 
# Access Network:

- An access network is a type of network which physically connects an end system to the immediate router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.
These are the networks that connect end-users to the core of the internet, like DSL, cable, fiber, and wireless (Wi-Fi and cellular networks).

# Physical Media:
<li>Physical media are the backbone of network communication. From twisted pair cables to fiber optics, each type has unique characteristics that affect data transmission.
Physical media refers to the physical materials used to transmit data, such as copper wires, fiber-optic cables, and wireless radio frequencies.</li>
