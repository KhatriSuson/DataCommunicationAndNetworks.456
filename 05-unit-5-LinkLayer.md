# The Link Layer and Local Area Networks (LAN)

The **link layer** is the lowest layer in the network stack and is responsible for communication over a single physical link between directly connected nodes.

## 5.1 Introduction to the Link Layer

The link layer provides essential services to ensure reliable and efficient communication between devices on the same network.

### 5.1.1 The Services Provided by the Link Layer

- **Framing**: Encapsulates network-layer packets into frames for transmission.
- **Error Detection/Correction**: Ensures data integrity by detecting and possibly correcting errors in the frame.
- **Medium Access Control (MAC)**: Determines which device can access the shared medium at a given time.
- **Real-Life Example**: A walkie-talkie system where users take turns speaking to avoid overlap.

## 5.2 Error-Detection and Correction Techniques

To ensure reliable data transfer, the link layer employs various techniques to detect and correct errors.

### 5.2.1 Parity Checks

- **Overview**: Adds a single parity bit to detect errors in the transmitted data.
- **Types**:
  - **Even Parity**: Ensures the total number of 1s is even.
  - **Odd Parity**: Ensures the total number of 1s is odd.
- **Real-Life Example**: A classroom attendance system that checks if the total count is correct.

### 5.2.2 Checksum Methods

- **Overview**: Computes a checksum by summing all the data bytes and appending it to the frame.
- **Real-Life Example**: Summing digits on a receipt to verify the total amount.

### 5.2.3 Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

- **Overview**: Uses polynomial division to detect errors in frames.
- **Benefits**:
  - Highly reliable.
  - Can detect burst errors.
- **Real-Life Example**: Barcodes scanned at a supermarket for error-free item identification.

## 5.3 Multiple Access Links and Protocols

Protocols that manage how multiple devices share the same communication channel.

### 5.3.1 Channel Partitioning Protocols

- **Overview**: Divides the channel into separate sections for each device.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**: Allocates time slots.
  - **Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)**: Allocates frequency bands.
- **Real-Life Example**: Scheduling gym equipment for specific time slots.

### 5.3.2 Random Access Protocols

- **Overview**: Devices transmit data whenever the channel is free, handling collisions as they occur.
- **Examples**:
  - **ALOHA**: Simplest protocol with retransmission on collision.
  - **CSMA/CD (Ethernet)**: Listens before transmitting to avoid collisions.
- **Real-Life Example**: A group discussion where participants jump in when no one is speaking.

### 5.3.3 Taking-Turns Protocols

- **Overview**: Devices take turns using the channel, avoiding collisions entirely.
- **Example**: Polling and token passing.
- **Real-Life Example**: A roundtable discussion where everyone gets a turn to speak.

### 5.3.4 DOCSIS: The Link-Layer Protocol for Cable Internet Access

- **DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)**:
  - Used for high-speed data over cable networks.
  - Ensures fair access and efficient use of the cable network.
- **Real-Life Example**: A shared cable TV system that also provides Internet access.

## 5.4 Switched Local Area Networks

Switched LANs use switches to efficiently connect multiple devices in a network.

### 5.4.1 Link-Layer Addressing and ARP

- **Link-Layer Addressing**: Each device has a unique MAC address.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:
  - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for communication within a LAN.
- **Real-Life Example**: A phone book mapping names (IP addresses) to phone numbers (MAC addresses).

### 5.4.2 Ethernet

- **Overview**: The most widely used link-layer protocol.
- **Features**:
  - Uses CSMA/CD for medium access.
  - Supports speeds from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps.
- **Real-Life Example**: Wired connections in an office network.

### 5.4.3 Link-Layer Switches

- **Function**: Connects devices within a LAN and forwards frames based on MAC addresses.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces collisions.
  - Increases network performance.
- **Real-Life Example**: A traffic cop directing vehicles at an intersection.

### 5.4.4 Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)

- **Overview**: Divides a physical network into multiple logical networks.
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved security.
  - Better traffic management.
- **Real-Life Example**: Separating a school’s staff and student networks on the same hardware.

## 5.5 A Day in the Life of a Web Page Request

Describes the step-by-step journey of a web page request through the network stack.

### 5.5.1 DHCP, UDP, IP, and Ethernet

- **DHCP**: Assigns an IP address to the client.
- **UDP and IP**: Transports the request to the destination.
- **Ethernet**: Delivers the request within the local network.
- **Real-Life Example**: Booking a table at a restaurant (IP assignment) before placing an order (data request).

### 5.5.2 DNS and ARP

- **DNS**: Resolves the website’s domain name to its IP address.
- **ARP**: Maps the resolved IP address to a MAC address.
- **Real-Life Example**: Looking up a restaurant's address (DNS) and checking its location on a map (ARP).

### 5.5.3 Intra-Domain Routing to the DNS Server

- Routes the DNS query within the ISP’s network to the DNS server.
- **Real-Life Example**: A mail carrier delivers a letter to the local sorting office before it goes to the destination.

### 5.5.4 Web Client-Server Interaction: TCP and HTTP

- **TCP**: Establishes a connection between the client and server.
- **HTTP**: Transfers the requested web page content.
- **Real-Life Example**: Calling a restaurant to place an order and receiving a confirmation.

### Summary

- The link layer provides vital services for error detection, framing, and media access control.
- Protocols like **Ethernet**, **ARP**, and **VLANs** make communication efficient and reliable within a LAN.
- Real-life analogies help us understand the flow of a web page request, from IP assignment to data retrieval.
