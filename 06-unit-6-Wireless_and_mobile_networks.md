# Wireless and Mobile Networks

Wireless and mobile networks enable communication without the need for physical cables, supporting mobility and flexible connectivity.

## 6.1 WiFi: 802.11 Wireless LANs

WiFi, based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, is the most widely used wireless LAN technology, providing high-speed internet access over short distances.

### 6.1.1 The 802.11 Wireless LAN Architecture

- **Components**:
  - **Access Point (AP)**: Acts as a bridge between the wireless network and the wired network.
  - **Wireless Station (STA)**: Any device with a wireless network interface.
  - **Basic Service Set (BSS)**: A group of devices communicating via the same AP.
  - **Extended Service Set (ESS)**: Multiple BSSs connected through a distribution system.
- **Real-Life Example**: A home router (AP) connects multiple devices (STAs) like phones and laptops to the internet.

### 6.1.2 The 802.11 MAC Protocol

- **Medium Access Control (MAC)**: Ensures devices share the wireless medium efficiently.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)**: Uses CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) to prevent collisions.
  - **Point Coordination Function (PCF)**: Centralized approach using the AP to manage access.
- **Real-Life Example**: People taking turns to speak in a meeting to avoid interruptions (CSMA/CA).

### 6.1.3 The IEEE 802.11 Frame

- **Frame Structure**:
  - **Header**: Includes source and destination MAC addresses, sequence control, and other information.
  - **Payload**: The actual data being transmitted.
  - **Trailer**: Contains error-checking information.
- **Key Features**:
  - Support for acknowledgments (ACKs) to ensure reliable delivery.
  - Power management information for energy-efficient operation.
- **Real-Life Example**: A package with a sender/receiver address (header), contents (payload), and a checklist to verify delivery (trailer).

### 6.1.4 Mobility in the Same IP Subnet

- **Overview**: Enables a device to move between access points within the same subnet without changing its IP address.
- **How It Works**:
  - The APs coordinate to maintain the connection.
  - The device undergoes a handoff process when switching APs.
- **Real-Life Example**: A phone call over WiFi that continues seamlessly while walking between rooms with different routers.

### 6.1.5 Personal Area Networks: Bluetooth

- **Overview**: A short-range wireless technology used for personal area networks (PANs).
- **Key Features**:
  - Operates in the 2.4 GHz band.
  - Supports data and voice communication.
  - Limited range (typically up to 10 meters).
- **Applications**:
  - Wireless headphones and speakers.
  - File transfer between devices.
- **Real-Life Example**: Connecting your smartphone to a Bluetooth speaker to play music.

### Summary

- WiFi (802.11) provides a flexible and high-speed wireless LAN architecture, with robust MAC protocols and frame structures to ensure efficient communication.
- Mobility within the same subnet ensures seamless transitions between access points.
- Bluetooth facilitates short-range communication, ideal for personal devices.
